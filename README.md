# 🎧 AutoDJ

**An intelligent DJ engine for automatic music mixing.**

AutoDJ analyzes the musical structure of tracks and automatically
constructs smooth, musically-aware transitions between them.

Rather than applying a fixed crossfade, AutoDJ uses digital signal
processing, optimization, and machine learning to reason about:

- tempo and beat alignment
- musical key and harmonic compatibility
- phrase and structural boundaries
- energy progression
- vocal overlap
- spectral characteristics
- transition compatibility

The long-term goal is simple:

> Give AutoDJ a collection of songs and let it build the mix.

## Project Status

Early development

The Python package foundation is in place. Audio processing is not implemented
yet. Next: WAV loading and metadata extraction, followed by waveform and
frequency analysis.

## Development

Requires Python 3.10 or newer. From the repository root:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -c "import autodj; print(autodj.__file__)"
```

There are no runtime dependencies or algorithm tests yet. Tests will accompany
the first audio component and use synthetic signals. Keep local input audio in
`assets/local/` and generated audio in `outputs/`; both are ignored by Git.
Public examples must use appropriately licensed audio.
